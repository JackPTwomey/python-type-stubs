Custom stubs for un-typed packages

More comprehensive type stubs for many packages can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/python-type-stubs, but these contain some inconsitencies and missing types for generic types such as `dict` or `Callable`.  
The typings provided here are only for minimal subsets of each package for classes/functions that I have personally used.
